=== Why the number of terms did not changed? ===

The number of terms is automatically updated on these events:

 * After editing dictionary settings.
 * After removing a term.
 * After adding a term when option "After postingâ€¦ Update dictionary statistics" selected.
 * With internal system maintenance tasks. The probability of running maintenance tasks is defined in `/inc/config.inc.php`, variable `$sys['prbblty_tasks']`. Default value is 3, it means 3 times per 100 page requests.
