=== How settings for visual theme and interface language work? ===

The scheme works this way:

 * Default visual theme (and interface language) is set in system settings.
 * A dictionary could have "the same as system" visual theme and interface language.
 * A dictionary could have its own default visual theme and interface language separately from system settings.
 * System settings will be used when a user searches in all dictionaries.

Examples:

 * I need "Theme A" for the site and "Theme B" for "Dictionary 1" only.
   * System settings: Theme A
   * "Dictionary 1": Theme B
   * "Dictionary 2": As system
   * "Dictionary 3": As system

 * I have one dictionary and it is assigned as main page. I need one theme.
   * System settings: Theme A
   * "Dictionary 1": As system

If a visual theme allows the user to select another visual theme and another interface language (other than the default), the new settings will be applied for the whole site.
