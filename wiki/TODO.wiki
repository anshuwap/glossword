The list of features:

 * 1.8.x Implementation of new interface translation engine.
 * 1.8.x The ability to export just one or several custom pages at a time.
 * 1.8.x Allow authors to edit the list of search keywords assigned for a selected term.
 * 1.8.x Random term.
 * 1.8.x The ability to include images in the definition (partially done).


 * 1.9.x Topics inside dictionaries (also called as "tags", "subdictionaries")
 * 1.9.x Bibliography.
 * 1.9.x RSS capability.
 * 1.9.x Search engine API.
 * 1.9.x Social bookmarking.
 * 1.9.x Support for MySQLi.

Application design:

 * Extend User management.
 * Create a "normal" HTML-editor.
 * RSS for almost any updated data. 
 * Remove "Clean cache" from interface. All caching schemes should be transparent.
 * Replace the text of database queries with dynamically created queries. Use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern ActiveRecord], for example.
 * Get rid of XML in stored data. All dictionary entries should be stored as database relations. Better if it would be InnoDB.
