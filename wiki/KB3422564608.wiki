=== What it means: "Table '.\glossword\x' is marked as crashed and should be repaired"? ===

It means there is an error in MySQL server and database needs to be repeared.

There is a long way to fix this. But you can receive a detailed
instructions in MySQL documentation, 
see 5.10.4.3. How to Repair Tables

 # Stop Apache and MySQL services.
 # Start -> Run -> type `cmd`, hit `[Enter]`
 # Go to directory `mysql/bin`:
{{{
c:\> e:
e:\> cd "e:\usr\bin\mysql5\bin"
}}}
_this is example for my computer, directory names can be different_

Now open MySQL documentation
[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/repair.html]

> Stage 1: Checking your tables

{{{
myisamchk.exe -e "e:/usr/bin/mysql5/data/glossword1_8/gw_xdtsffjq"
}}}

Next steps are covered in MySQL documentation quite well.
