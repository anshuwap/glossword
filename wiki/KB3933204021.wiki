How to update from 1.7.0 to 1.8.4

=== How to update from 1.7.0 to 1.8.4 ===

You can export terms into XML format in version 1.7.0, install 1.8.4 and import XML-file into 1.8.4.

_Note:_ There is an issue with exporting terms in 1.7.0 - a short date range. This has been fixed, see file [http://groups.google.com/group/glossword/files?hl=en inc-for-exporting-1.7.0.zip]

For 1.7.0 it is possible to update to 1.8.3. The script to update from such old versions exists prior to 1.8.3.
