=== How to create a translation? ===

DO NOT EDIT PHP-files manually. Because there are a lot of technical questions you need to resolve. Alteration of the files may cause Glossword to malfunction. 

The most common errors: 

 * Incorrect encoding (must be UTF-8 without [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark Byte Order Mark]);

 * HTML-entities instead of Unicode characters (ex. "Compatibilit&agrave;" instead of "Compatibilità");

 * Missed characters (ex. "Termini inizianti con ?%s?'" instead of "Termini inizianti con ‘%s’");

 * Incorrect markup (ex "`"<em>ab*</em>"`" instead of "`&quot;<em>ab*</em>&quot;`");

 * Unnecessary "Line feed" character in the end of files (ex. "\x3F\x3E\x0D\x0A" instead of "\x3F\x3E", \x3F is hexademical value for `?` and \x3E is `>`).

_However, it is possible to avoid some errors by using Unicode-compatible text editor. For example EmEditor, Notepad++, SC UniPad._


Instead of editing PHP-files, download archive with source phrases in MS Excel format:

It is easy to edit. You have two columns - "Source" and "Target".  
Write your translation variant into the "Target". 
Save and send MS Excel file to my email dev at glossword dot info.
Later than I will send you working PHP-files with translation.
If you will have a questions during translation process, please ask them to me. 


=== Translation example ===

Here is the fragment of `global.xls`:

|| ID || Source || Target ||
|| 1277 || An interesting page ||  ||
|| select_off || Uncheck all ||  ||

To translate it, for example, to Spanish, make this section looks like:

|| ID || Source || Target ||
|| 1277 || An interesting page || Una página interesante ||
|| select_off || Uncheck all || Desmarcar todos ||

Save the file and translation is complete.

_Perhaps, there are will be no translation files at all in the next Glossword version 1.8.x. Everything will be stored in database. It will allow to create translations faster and easier._
