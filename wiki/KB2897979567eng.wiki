=== How to create a translation? ===

To create your translation variant for Glossword 
please do not try to edit translation PHP-files directly. 
Because there are a lot of technical questions you need to resolve. 

Instead, download archive with source phrases in MS Excel format:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44374

It is easy to edit. You have two columns - "Source" and "Target".  
Write your translation variant into the "Target". 
Save and send MS Excel file to my email dev at glossword dot info. 
If you will have a questions during translation process, please ask them to me. 


=== Translation example ===

Here is the fragment of `global.xls`:

|| ID || Source || Target ||
|| 1277 || An interesting page ||  ||
|| select_off || Uncheck all ||  ||

To translate it, for example, to Spanish, make this section looks like:

|| ID || Source || Target ||
|| 1277 || An interesting page || Una p√°gina interesante ||
|| select_off || Uncheck all || Desmarcar todos ||

Save the file and translation is complete.

_Hopefully, the next Glossword version 1.8.5 will not have translation files at all. 
Everything will be stored in database._
