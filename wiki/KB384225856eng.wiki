#summary Troubleshooting "HTTP 404.11 - Not Found" under IIS
#labels Solution,IIS

=== Why I'm receiving message "HTTP 404.11 - Not Found. The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that contains a double escape sequence"? ===

*Q:* When I start with `http://127.0.0.1/glossword/1.8/index.php/index/Example+dictionary.xhtml`, 
I have the following message:

{{{
HTTP 404.11 - Not Found.
The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that contains a double escape sequence
}}}

*A:* It happen when you have configured Glossword to use SEF-mode (Search engine friendly URLs). By default, IIS 7.0 rejects URLs with a double escape sequence. Open file `web.config` and set `allowDoubleEscaping`:
{{{
<system.webServer>
    ...
    <security>
        <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping="True"/>
    </security>
    ...
</system.webServer>
}}}
