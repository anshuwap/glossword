== Glossword Lifecycle Policy ==

=== Introduction ===

The Glossword Lifecycle Policy provides guidelines and timeframes of support available for the software from when the product is General Availability (GA) for download to the time the product is no longer supported (End of Support, EOS). Glossword users can use this document to plan upgrade paths.

Since 1st May 2008, there are two support policies: Standard Support Lifecycle Policy and Enhanced Support Lifecycle Policy.

=== Standard Support Lifecycle Policy ===

There is *"Three versions"* rule which applies to the timeframe. The support is provided for the current and *three* previously released versions. See Lifecycle Calendar below.

=== Enhanced Support Lifecycle Policy ===

The timeframe includes Standard Support Lifecycle Policy timeframe plus *three* previously released versions. See Lifecycle Calendar below.

Customers with support needs beyond the Enhanced Lifecycle timeframe can negotiate custom agreements.
