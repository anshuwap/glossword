#summary How to use back-up files?

Let me give a short introduction into database administration course.

This is SQL-dump, a file with database commands. These files could be
very large, for example, the commands for a dictionary with 50.000 terms
could take 30 MBytes or more. You can't upload it with a browser unless you
have a broadband Internet connection. But in the most cases, a hosting provider
just not allows you to upload such big files into his database administration
tool (phpMyAdmin or custom). The general purpose of SQL-dump is to import
it using the command line:

{{{
# mysql database_name -u username -p < dumpfile.sql
}}}

The most of hosting companies provides information about how to use
a command line interface (via SSH) for their clients. 
A cheap hosting does not have command line interface at all, usually.
